## Remarks
- These latest additions truly enhance the study environment created by our solution. The Pomodoro timer helps users manage their time effectively, promoting focused study sessions while ensuring adequate breaks for rest and rejuvenation. Additionally, the todo list feature empowers users to organize their tasks and prioritize their study goals efficiently.

- By incorporating these features alongside the soothing music and adjustable lofi beats, we have created a holistic study environment that addresses various aspects of the learning process. The aim is to provide students with not only a platform for studying but also a supportive toolkit for maintaining concentration, managing time, and staying organized throughout their learning journey.
